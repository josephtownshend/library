# Library App
This app will enable borrowers to log the books they take out on loan. Initial loan period will be one week.
It is a work-in-progress that was started during an Innovation Day hosted by Alfa Systems by a team of 7.

Technologies used include React and Spring Boot.

## Key Stories

As an library user, I want to see a list of books that are in the library, before I go to the library. - GET request

As a library manager, when I have a new book, I want to add it to the library.  - POST request

As library user, when I am interested in a book, I want to see the title and author of that book


## Borrowing Actions

As a library user, when I really like a book, I want to take it out on loan.

As a library user, when I take out a book, I want to know when book is due back in the library, so I can return it on time (concept: fix it to a week initially)
